## Rendering News Updates

To render the `news_updates.Rmd` file to HTML, you can use the `rmarkdown::render` function. Here's an example:

```r
# Render the news_updates.Rmd file
rmarkdown::render("news_updates.Rmd", output_dir = "docs")
```

This command will generate an HTML file named `news_updates.html` in the `docs` directory. You can then link this file in your package's HTML as shown in the updated `create_html.R` script.
