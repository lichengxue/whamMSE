Description: A flexible and comprehensive toolbox for conducting management strategy
    evaluation (MSE) to support spatially explicit management of complex, heterogeneous
    fish populations. Built upon the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM), a state-space
    age-structured stock assessment framework that accommodates time- and age-varying
    process errors and environmental covariates, whamMSE extends WHAM with a fully
    configurable multi-stock, multi-region operating model. The package supports
    age-, year-, stock-, and season-specific movement (fixed or random effects),
    alternative movement structures, and environmental effects on population and
    movement processes. 

    whamMSE provides tools to simulate and evaluate management procedures—including
    survey design, data collection methods, stock assessment models, projections,
    harvest control rules, and management implementation error—within a closed-loop
    MSE framework. Users can explore how alternative spatial, ecological, and
    environmental scenarios influence assessment accuracy, management performance,
    and long-term stock dynamics across regions. A user-friendly Shiny interface is
    included for interactive configuration of biological, fishery, and movement
    inputs.
