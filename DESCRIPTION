Title: Management Strategy Evaluation Tool for the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM)

Description: A comprehensive toolbox for conducting management strategy evaluation (MSE)
    to support spatial management of complex, heterogeneous fish populations. The package
    is built upon the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM), a state-space age-structured stock
    assessment model that can incorporate time- and/or age-varying process errors (treated
    as random effects) and environmental effects on population processes. whamMSE provides
    tools to simulate and evaluate management strategies (combinations of data collection
    methods, stock assessment models, and harvest control rules), allowing users to explore
    how alternative scenarios affect estimation and management performance for fish stocks
    with different life-history traits across regions.
